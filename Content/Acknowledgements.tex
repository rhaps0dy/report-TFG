\centeredtitle{Acknowledgements}

To my supervisor Anders Jonsson, for the guidance offered in navigating the
literature, in carrying out this project. I also want to thank him for getting
me interested into the fascinating field of \acs{RL}.

To my good friend and upperclassman Daniel Furelos, for being an academic role
model to follow, and for the offered advice.

To my parents and sister for the moral support, and the support of a noisy,
electricity-hungry computer that is continuously learning and planning.

Thank you all!
